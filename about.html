                 <p id="Bio">The story of Attack on Titan revolves around the adventures of Eren Yeager who lives in the town of Shinganshina. When Wall Maria is breached by the Colossal Titan, with the Armored Titan further compromising the town, chaos ensues as the Titans enters Shinganshina causing a mass evacuation. Eren vows to kill all the Titans after watching in horror as a smiling Titan eats his mother, Carla, his father having mysteriously disappeared after giving him a key to their basement. He then enlists in the military with his friends Mikasa, and Armin. Five years later, the three cadet graduates are positioned in Trost District, one of the border towns jutting out of Wall Rose when the Colossal Titan again appears. In the ensuing battle, Eren appears to have been killed when he sacrificed himself to save Armin from being eaten by a bearded Titan. Things appear bleak until Mikasa and Armin encounter a Titan that uncharacteristically attacks the other Titans with raging fury. The creature is ultimately revealed to be Eren.</p>
